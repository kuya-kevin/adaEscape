Description: "Escape" is a text-based game that aims to highlight three features unique to Ada: nested subprograms, exception handling, and typing (derived types and subtypes). 
You are a patient in the hospital, and your task is to escape the building. 
In order to load states of the game, a text file (state1/2/3/4/5.txt) with character information is read from, and a file "out.txt" is written into, with values changing based on the choices you make in the main program (escape.adb). 

To compile Ada programs:
    gnatmake escape.adb

To run the executable program.
    ./escape
